# SafeClaw 🐾

**The zero-cost alternative to OpenClaw. No LLM required. No API bills. Minimal attack surface. Runs on any machine.**

> **250 STARS** — We hit 250 stars on GitHub! This milestone brings: **Real Research, Simple AI Setup, and Smart Learning.** Research now searches arXiv and Semantic Scholar for real academic papers, asks Wolfram Alpha for computational answers. `setup ai sk-ant-your-key` instantly configures Anthropic (or any provider) — or `setup ai local` for free Ollama. The parser auto-corrects typos, converts word-numbers ("one" → 1), and learns from your mistakes automatically. [See the new features below.](#-real-research-sources) Previous milestone: [Fuzzy Learning & Personalization.](#-writing-style-profiler) Next milestone: **500 stars** 🤯

While OpenClaw users are burning [$200/day](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Free-to-use-AI-tool-can-burn-through-hundreds-of-Dollars-per-day-OpenClaw-has-absurdly-high-token-use.1219925.0.html) and [$3,600/month](https://dev.to/thegdsks/i-tried-the-free-ai-agent-with-124k-github-stars-heres-my-500-reality-check-2885) on API tokens, SafeClaw delivers 90% of the functionality using traditional programming — rule-based parsing, ML pipelines, and local-first tools. **Your API bill: $0. Forever.**

SafeClaw uses VADER, spaCy, sumy, YOLO, Whisper, Piper, and other battle-tested ML techniques instead of generative AI. The result: deterministic, predictable, private, and completely free to run.

## Why SafeClaw?

| | SafeClaw | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost** | **$0** | $100–$3,600+ |
| **Requires LLM** | No (optional for AI blog) | Yes |
| **Prompt injection risk** | **Minimal** (only if LLM research enabled) | Yes (everywhere) |
| **Works offline** | **Yes** (core features) | No |
| **Runs on any machine** | **Yes** (Linux, macOS, Windows) | Needs powerful hardware or cloud APIs |
| **Deterministic output** | **Yes** | No (LLM responses vary) |
| **Privacy** | **Local by default** (external only when you ask, e.g. weather) | Data sent to API providers |

## Features

### 🗣️ Voice Control
* **Speech-to-Text** — Whisper STT runs locally, no cloud transcription
* **Text-to-Speech** — Piper TTS for natural voice output, completely offline
* **Voice-first workflow** — Talk to SafeClaw like you would any assistant

### 🏠 Smart Home & Device Control
* **Smart home integration** — Control your connected devices
* **Bluetooth device control** — Discover and manage Bluetooth devices
* **Network scanning** — Device discovery on your local network

### 📱 Social Media Intelligence
* **Twitter/X summarization** — Add accounts, get summaries of their activity
* **Mastodon summarization** — Follow and summarize fediverse accounts
* **Bluesky summarization** — Track and summarize Bluesky feeds
* No API tokens needed for public content

### 📰 RSS News Aggregation
* **50+ preset feeds** — Hacker News, Ars Technica, BBC, Reuters, Nature, and more
* **8 categories** — Tech, World, Science, Business, Programming, Security, Linux, AI
* **Custom feeds** — Import any RSS/Atom feed
* **Auto-summarization** — Extractive summaries with sumy (no AI)
* **Per-user preferences** — Customize your news sources

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
* **Self-hosted by default** — Your data stays local unless you explicitly request external info (like weather)
* **No API keys required** — Core features work completely offline
* **No cloud AI dependencies** — No tokens sent to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google
* **Minimal prompt injection surface** — Core features (blogging, coding, commands) use rule-based parsing with zero LLM, so they're immune to prompt injection. Research and deep analysis *can* optionally use an LLM to synthesize sources — when enabled, content from external sources (arXiv abstracts, web pages) is fed to the LLM, which carries a minimal prompt injection risk. Phase 1 research (gathering/summarizing) never uses an LLM and is safe. We're transparent about this tradeoff.

## Writing Style & Research Guide

### Writing Style Profiler

SafeClaw learns how you write by analyzing text samples. It builds a statistical profile — no AI needed.

```
> style learn I've been thinking about this for a while. The tech industry
  loves to overcomplicate things. Simple solutions work better.
  Profile updated (1 sample analyzed).

> style learn Here's what I learned from shipping 50 side projects: most
  of them failed. And that's completely fine!
  Profile updated (2 samples analyzed).

> style profile
  Writing Style Profile (2 samples analyzed)
  Tone: casual, neutral
  Avg sentence: 7 words
  Vocabulary: advanced (richness: 72%)
  Structure: conversational
  Uses contractions, first person, em-dashes
  Favorite words: easier, simple, something, learn
```

Your profile persists across sessions and automatically shapes AI blog prompts so generated posts sound like you.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `style learn <text>` | Feed SafeClaw a writing sample |
| `style profile` | View your current writing profile |

### Research Pipeline

Two-phase research: gather first (free), then optionally analyze with AI.

```

  Auto-blog 'weekly-tech' scheduled: 0 9 * * 1

> auto blog list
  weekly-tech: 0 9 * * 1 (tech, ai)

> auto blog remove weekly-tech
  Removed.
```

### Task-Aware Prompt Builder

Each task type (blog, research, coding) gets optimized prompts. Configure per-task LLM providers:

```yaml
task_providers:
  blog: "local-ollama"       # Blog posts use local Ollama
  research: "openai"         # Research uses OpenAI for quality
  coding: "local-lmstudio"   # Code tasks use LM Studio
```

Run `show me the flow` to see the full architecture diagram.

## Blogging Guide

SafeClaw has two blogging modes. You can use either or both.

### Mode 1: Deterministic Blog (No AI)

Write entries manually, crawl websites for content, and let SafeClaw generate titles using extractive summarization (LexRank, TextRank, LSA, Luhn). No API keys, no cost, fully offline.

**Setup:** None — works out of the box.

```
> write blog news We shipped faster crawling today.
  Added entry (1 total).

> crawl https://example.com for title content
  Extracted 3 titles, added to draft.

> blog title
  Generated: "Faster Crawling Ships Today"

> publish blog
  Saved: 2026-02-24-faster-crawling-ships-today.txt
```

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `write blog news <content>` | Add a manual entry to your draft |
| `crawl <url> for title content` | Extract page headings into draft |
| `crawl <url> for body content` | Extract main body text into draft |
| `crawl <url> for non-title content` | Extract non-heading text into draft |
| `blog title` | Generate a title using extractive summarization |
| `show blog` | View your draft and published posts |
| `edit blog <new content>` | Replace draft content |
| `publish blog` | Save as `.txt` locally |
| `publish blog My Custom Title` | Save with a custom title |

### Mode 2: AI Blog (Optional)

AI generates full blog posts from a topic. You can rewrite, expand, generate headlines, and produce SEO metadata. Supports 11 providers — 5 local (free) and 6 cloud (API key required).

**Setup:**

1. **Choose a provider.** For free/private, use a local provider. For quality/speed, use a cloud provider.

2. **Configure it in `config/config.yaml`** under `ai_providers`. Uncomment and fill in one or more:

**Local AI (free, private, no API key):**

```yaml
ai_providers:
  # Ollama — easiest local option
  - label: "local-ollama"
    provider: "ollama"
    model: "llama3.1"
    endpoint: "http://localhost:11434/api/chat"

  # LM Studio — GUI app with model browser
  # - label: "local-lmstudio"
  #   provider: "lm_studio"
  #   model: "local-model"
  #   endpoint: "http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions"

  # llama.cpp — high-performance C++ inference
  # - label: "local-llamacpp"
  #   provider: "llamacpp"
  #   model: "local-model"
  #   endpoint: "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions"

  # Jan — user-friendly desktop app
  # - label: "local-jan"
  #   provider: "jan"
  #   model: "llama3.1-8b"
  #   endpoint: "http://localhost:1337/v1/chat/completions"
```

**Cloud AI (API key required):**

```yaml
ai_providers:
  # OpenAI
  - label: "openai"
    provider: "openai"
    api_key: "sk-..."              # https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
    model: "gpt-4o"

  # Anthropic (Claude)
  # - label: "anthropic"
  #   provider: "anthropic"
  #   api_key: "sk-ant-..."        # https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
  #   model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

  # Google Gemini
  # - label: "google"
  #   provider: "google"
  #   api_key: "AI..."             # https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
  #   model: "gemini-1.5-flash"

  # Mistral
  # - label: "mistral"
  #   provider: "mistral"
  #   api_key: "..."               # https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys
  #   model: "mistral-large-latest"

  # Groq (fast inference)
  # - label: "groq"
  #   provider: "groq"
  #   api_key: "gsk_..."           # https://console.groq.com/keys
  #   model: "llama-3.1-70b-versatile"
```

3. **Install the local AI server** (if using local):

```bash
# Ollama (recommended — one command)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.1

# LM Studio — download from https://lmstudio.ai
# Jan — download from https://jan.ai
# llama.cpp — git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp && make
```

4. **Use it:**

```
> blog
  1. AI Blog for You (Recommended) [ollama/llama3.1]
  2. Manual Blogging (No AI)

> 1
  What should the blog post be about?

> sustainable technology trends in 2026
  AI-Generated Blog Post
  Provider: ollama/llama3.1 (847 tokens)

### Publishing to Remote Platforms

Publish your blog (from either mode) to WordPress, Joomla, any SFTP server, or a generic API endpoint.

**Setup:** Add one or more targets to `config/config.yaml` under `publish_targets`:

```yaml
publish_targets:
  # WordPress (REST API v2)
  - label: "my-wordpress"
    type: "wordpress"
    url: "https://mysite.com"
    username: "admin"
    password: "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"   # Application Password (WP Admin > Users > Profile)
    wp_status: "publish"              # publish, draft, pending, private

  # Joomla (Web Services API, Joomla 4+)
  - label: "my-joomla"
    type: "joomla"
    url: "https://myjoomla.com"
    api_key: "your-joomla-api-token"  # Joomla Admin > Users > API Token
    joomla_category_id: 2

  # SFTP (any server)
  - label: "my-server"
    type: "sftp"
    sftp_host: "myserver.com"
    sftp_user: "deploy"
    sftp_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    sftp_remote_path: "/var/www/html/blog"

  # Generic API (POST JSON to any endpoint)
  - label: "my-api"
    type: "api"
    url: "https://api.mysite.com/posts"
    api_key: "your-bearer-token"
```

**Publishing commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `publish blog to my-wordpress` | Publish to a specific target |
| `publish blog to all` | Publish to all enabled targets |
| `list publish targets` | Show configured targets |
| `set front page <id> on <target>` | Set which post is the home page |
| `show front page` | Show current front page setting |
| `list pages for <target>` | List available pages/posts on a target |

### Deterministic vs AI: Quick Comparison

| | Deterministic | AI-Powered |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $0 | $0 (local) or pay-per-token (cloud) |
| **Privacy** | Fully local | Local AI = local; cloud = data sent to provider |
| **Titles** | Extractive summarization | LLM-generated |
| **Content** | Manual writing + crawling | LLM generates from topic |
| **Speed** | Instant | Seconds (local) to seconds (cloud) |
| **Determinism** | 100% reproducible | Varies by model/temperature |
| **Setup** | None | Install local AI or add cloud API key |

## How It Works (No AI!)

### Command Parsing

Instead of burning tokens on LLMs, SafeClaw uses:

1. **Keyword matching** — Fast lookup of command keywords
2. **Regex patterns** — Structured extraction of parameters
3. **Fuzzy matching** — Typo tolerance with rapidfuzz
4. **Specificity-weighted phrase matching** — Longer, more specific phrases win over short keyword collisions
5. **Date parsing** — Natural language dates with dateparser

```
# Example: "remind me to call mom tomorrow at 3pm"
# → intent: "reminder"
# → params: {task: "call mom", time: "tomorrow at 3pm"}
# → entities: {datetime: 2024-01-16 15:00:00}
```

### Voice Pipeline

Fully local voice processing — no cloud APIs, no per-minute billing:

* **Whisper STT** — OpenAI's Whisper model running locally for speech recognition
* **Piper TTS** — Fast, high-quality text-to-speech with multiple voice options

### Summarization

Uses [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy)'s extractive algorithms:

* **LexRank** — Graph-based, like PageRank for sentences
* **TextRank** — Word co-occurrence graphs
* **LSA** — Latent Semantic Analysis
* **Luhn** — Statistical word frequency

No neural networks, no API calls — pure math.

### Social Media Summarization

Add Twitter, Mastodon, or Bluesky accounts and get extractive summaries of their recent posts. No API tokens needed for public content. Useful for tracking industry voices, news accounts, or competitors without doomscrolling.

### Web Crawling

Async crawling with httpx + BeautifulSoup:

* Single page link extraction
* Multi-page crawling with depth limits
* Domain filtering and pattern matching
* Built-in caching

---

## Extending SafeClaw

### Custom Actions

```python
from safeclaw.actions.base import BaseAction

class MyAction(BaseAction):
    name = "myaction"

    async def execute(self, params, user_id, channel, engine):
        # Your logic here
        return "Action completed!"

# Register it
engine.register_action("myaction", MyAction().execute)
```

### Custom Intent Patterns

Add to `config/intents.yaml`:

```yaml
intents:
  deploy:
    keywords: ["deploy", "release", "ship"]
    patterns:
      - "deploy to (production|staging)"
    examples:
      - "deploy to production"
    action: "webhook"
```

### Plugin System

Plugins are automatically loaded from the plugins directory:

```
src/safeclaw/plugins/
├── official/          # Curated, tested plugins
│   └── smarthome.py
├── community/         # User-contributed plugins
│   └── your_plugin.py
├── base.py            # BasePlugin class
└── loader.py          # Plugin loader
```

## Who Is SafeClaw For?

**SafeClaw is for you if:**
* You want automation without API bills
* You're tired of unpredictable OpenClaw costs
* Privacy matters to you — your data stays local by default
* You prefer deterministic, predictable behavior
* You want voice control without paying for ElevenLabs
* You need social media monitoring without the doomscroll
* You want smart home and Bluetooth control in one tool
* You want AI blogging with your choice of provider (or no AI at all)
* You want to publish to WordPress, Joomla, or any server from the CLI
* You want an assistant that learns how you write and adapts to your style
* You want a research pipeline that gathers before it spends tokens
* You need code templates and utilities without spinning up an LLM
* You don't need free-form AI conversation

**Stick with OpenClaw if:**
* You need autonomous multi-step reasoning
* Free-form conversation is essential
* You want the AI to write its own skills
* Browser automation is a core need
